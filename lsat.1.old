.SH NAME 
lsat \- a security auditing tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
lsat [options] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lsat
Linux Security Auditing Tool (LSAT) is a post install security auditing tool. It is modular in design, so new features can be added quickly. It checks inetd entries and scans for unneeded RPM packages. It is being expanded to work with Linux distributions other than Red Hat, and checks for kernel versions.
