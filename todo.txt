check to see if the boot drive is mounted or writable. IT
should not be.

disable usb storage? Or at least throw a warning.

see if our checks are still valid. We used to do rpm and 
yum, but we can do things like apt-cache pkgnames to show
packages on ubuntu/deb

sshd conf also check

PermitRootLogin no
Protocol2
IgnoreRhosts to yes
HostbasedAuthentication no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
X11Forwarding no
MaxAuthTries 5
Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr
ClientAliveInterval 900 
ClientAliveCountMax 0
UsePAM yes

Is SELinux enabled?

In the link above, you can add some checks to pam to see
if password policies are enabled, like recalling old passwords,
and also strong passwords.

Hrm, I never thought about checking cron permissions.
In the link, they note that one should check /etc/cron* and
also /etc/anacrontab and see if they are root:root
and og-rwx (so 600?)

check u/g owner perms on /etc/{passwd, group, shadow, gshadow}

I like his last suggestion about randomized virtual mem
region placement. Perhaps we can check that and the core
dumps (pretty sure I check core now), and I need to look
up exec shield
